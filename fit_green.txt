>No, I don’t, as long as those people are the only ‘thing’ that gets damaged.
>>And where would those civilians get their guns from?

>Fast is a thread for the discussion of intermittent fasting, fasting, water fasting, and dry fasting.
>Intermittent fasting: Fasting for a certain amount of time with a short eating window. 16:8 (16 hours fasting, 8 hour eating window) is the bare minimum.
>Water fasting: Fasting with only water.
>Dry fasting: Fasting with no water. Dangerous, use with caution.
>Read all of these, they might answer some other questions you may want to ask.
>Take snake juice, or just supplement electrolytes.
>Water=2L
>Potassium chloride =1 tsp (No Salt)
>Sodium chloride = 1/2 tsp (Himalayan Pink Salt)
>Sodium Bicarbonate = 1 tsp (Baking Soda)
>Magnesium Sulphate = 1/2 tsp (Food Grade Epsom Salts)
>Mix these in 2L of water and sip it throughout the day.
>[OPTIONAL] 2 tbsp Apple cider vinegar and 4 tbsp lemon juice. DO NOT MIX with snake juice, drink separately.
>You can also do this if you feel lightheaded, weak, dizzy, nauseous, etc., on shorter water fasts. Don’t do this while intermittent fasting.
>No. You won't have the willpower to fast that low.
>Yes, headarse.
>You can do whatever the fuck you want. We recommend avoiding those, sweeteners especially.
>No

>In this review we have analyzed the 13 known quantitative dietary studies of HG and demonstrate that animal food actually provided the dominant (65%) energy source, while gathered plant foods comprised the remainder (35%). This data is consistent with a more recent, comprehensive review of the entire ethnographic data (n=229HG societies) that showed the mean subsistence dependence upon gathered plant foods was 32%, whereas it was 68% for animal foods. Other evidence, including isotopic analyses of Paleolithic hominid collagen tissue, reductions in hominid gut size, low activity levels of certain enzymes, and optimal foraging data all point toward a long history of meat-based diets in our species.

>They found that CRC risk was positively associated with the intake of red and processed meat
>White meat (fish and poultry) is not associated with CRC risk and is recommended safely
>On the other hand, for humans meat is a major food that contains all essential amino acids (lysine, threonine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, leucine, isoleucine and valine) and various micronutrients such as iron, zinc, selenium and vitamin B6, B12 and vitamin D.13 It is also significant source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
>Meat is an important source of nutrients and should be consumed moderately and balanced with other foods.

>We know that intelligence is genetics based
>We know that every single structure and protein in the human body has to be genetics based since there's no magical black hole that just spews out new amino acid sequences
>We know that there are genetic differences between races because we can trace those SNPs over thousands of generations
>We know that those genetic differences lead to different expressions of certain proteins and enzymes which lead to different Phenotypes (Think asians who have less ADH and therefor a worse alcohol metabolism)
>We accept all of these statements as true and proveable
>However suggesting that Ingelligence, which is genetics based and different genetic compositions of races might fall together and explain THE DIFFERENCE IN INTELLIGENCE BETWEEN RACES is complete horseshit since the brain is a mystical vortex of feel good energy that just generates new structures and proteins based on how nice we are to our fellow beings

> sure everything else has known differences 
> sure anyone who tries to point out evidence in favor of genetic differences in the brain gets shitcanned so they generally keep quiet 
> sure anonymous surveys of the field find the majority think that genetics influences iq differently across different races

>Who Are the IQ Experts?
>Men, mostly. That 83% of them are male could be because of male standard deviation advantage, in that exceptional ability is more likely in males (as is the exceptional lack of it). Even more precisely, it would fit the hypothesis that men are also 3 points ahead of women. They are of middle age, which is what one becomes after reading all the required literature (same pattern as in 1984). However, if 30 year olds bother to do the reading they can quickly contribute to it. 7 people over 70 are still publishing. The experts are well-published; and left-wing. The last point may come as a surprise. They tend towards liberal rather than conservative opinions. They are left of centre by 2 to 1. They are strongly in favour of gay marriage, in favour of more social democratic policies and of immigration. They are less keen on, though not totally opposed to “strong affirmative action”.
>They come from middle class backgrounds, as one would expect of the children of better educated and probably brighter parents. They are mostly European, often Jewish. They studied psychology, have PhDs, and are mostly in universities. Two thirds of them are not religious. 75% regard themselves as Jensenists, meaning that IQ has a general factor and is heritable.
>Experts sometimes talk to the media, but have a generally poor opinion of it. As of 2013/2014 they rated two particular bloggers far more highly. They find the public debates about intelligence are mostly (two thirds) based on ideology. They have often hesitated to give their opinions in public. They also think that intelligence research could be abused in political settings. On balance, they think that 51% of the black-white difference in intelligence in the US is caused by environmental factors.

>says IQ only matters up to 100. Ignores that the populations in question are below 100 so it matters.
>Writes that thinking things are static when really they change is a big mistake people make. Ignores that IQ matters at different levels for different things.
>Says that IQ is meaningless because it only predicts on the low side. Can't fathom the concept of "necessary but not sufficient".
>Says it should only be used for the thing it was designed for. Doesn't know that something can be created for one purpose but also useful for other things.
>Admits that he doesn't like IQ because it gives race realists ammunition. Not an argument.

>Norm violation and leadership potential were unaffected by hairstyle.
>Attractiveness, in contrast, was significantly lower with a shaved head.
>Men who had their hair digitally removed in a photograph were perceived as more dominant by the respondents in this study than the same men with hair, and this effect was due to a large degree by their higher perceived confidence and masculinity.
>These perceptions, moreover, extended beyond attribute ratings to dominance-related physical characteristics of the men. Namely, the men were viewed as nearly an inch taller and 13% stronger when pictured with shaved heads versus with hair.

>Intermittent fasting: Fasting for a certain amount of time with a short eating window. 16:8 (16 hours fasting, 8 hour eating window) is the bare minimum.
>Water fasting: Fasting with only water.
>Dry fasting: Fasting with no water. Dangerous, use with caution.
>Read all of these, they might answer some other questions you may want to ask.
>Take snake juice, or just supplement electrolytes.

>[OPTIONAL] 2 tbsp Apple cider vinegar and 4 tbsp lemon juice. DO NOT MIX with snake juice, drink separately.

>The effect of smiling on interpersonal attraction and perception was examined in a 2 (sex of perceiver) x 2 (sex of stimulus person) x 2 (facial expression) experiment. Ss were presented a photograph of a stimulus person either smiling or not smiling. Results lend strong support to the prediction that Ss liked a smiling person more and evaluated him or her more positively than a nonsmiling person. Moreover, a smiling person was perceived to be more intelligent and could create in the perceiver a warm feeling more so than a nonsmiling person.
>The present study investigated the effect of smiling on male facial attractiveness for short- and long-term prospective partners using East Asian and European samples. In Experiment 1 (N = 218), where female participants rated male facial attractiveness, the facilitative effect of smiling was present when judging long-term partners but absent for short-term partners. This pattern was observed for East Asians as well as for Europeans. Experiment 2 (N = 71) demonstrated that smiling male faces engendered an impression suitable for long-term partnership (e.g., high ratings of trustworthiness) while neutral faces produced an impression suitable for short-term partnership (e.g., high ratings of masculinity).

>Dr John Ong’ech, a reproductive health specialist at Kenyatta National Hospital says it is possible though such incidences are rare.
>“It is possible that a woman can go into vaginismus. This is when the muscles around the vagina tighten involuntarily when there is an attempt to penetrate it. However, this can happen during intercourse when the penile shaft has already been inserted and the muscles close in, zapping and locking on it,” he says.
>Scientifically it is described as penis captivas.
>The vaginal muscles of the woman clamp down on the penile shaft and sometimes the man is unable to withdraw even after losing his erection.
>This would then mean that doctors would have to come in to separate the couple.

>Thus, having the highest possible relative strength should be your primary concern, rather than the greatest absolute strength. This, of course, flies in the face of the conventional online wisdom that "he who lifts the most wins", as anyone who's not a sloppy fucking mass of adipose tissue would be far more impressed with a stupendous lift by a guy with visable musculature than they would with a Louis Cyr lookalike's world-shattering lift. This is why everyone shits their pants about Stan Efferding, Joe Ladnier, and Matt Kroczaleski when there's a new record broken in the squat by a different circus fat man every 45 minutes. This is also the reason why most of you know who 170 lb Bulgarian Olympic Ivan Stoitsov is, and have seen his pic a thousand times, but have no idea who Tatiana Kashirina is, in spite of the fact that she probably clean and jerks what you deadlift.
>If you're wondering why no one knows the name of a fat Russian chick who holds the world record in the clean and press and the snatch (a chick who probably outlifts the vast majority of us on just about everything), don't. Fat people aren't really people- they're placeholders where people should be. No one wants to look at them, strong or not, nor be around them long enough to locate their genitalia and fuck. They look like shit, wheeze when they breathe, and are in mortal danger of stroking out when doing anything other than doing a single repetition on one of their pet exercises or eating. This doesn't change much when a fat guy or girl picks up something heavy- we expect them to be able to do so when the object they're lifting is a fraction of their bodyweight, no matter how heavy that object is. Thus, if really doesn't matter that a fat person is all that strong.

>Method and Results: In this review we have analyzed the 13 known quantitative dietary studies of HG and demonstrate that animal food actually provided the dominant (65%) energy source, while gathered plant foods comprised the remainder (35%). This data is consistent with a more recent, comprehensive review of the entire ethnographic data (n=229HG societies) that showed the mean subsistence dependence upon gathered plant foods was 32%, whereas it was 68% for animal foods. Other evidence, including isotopic analyses of Paleolithic hominid collagen tissue, reductions in hominid gut size, low activity levels of certain enzymes, and optimal foraging data all point toward a long history of meat-based diets in our species.

>Contrary to popular belief, consuming a higher amount of fat (about 35 per cent of energy) is associated with a lower risk of death compared to lower intakes. However, a diet high in carbohydrates (of more than 60 per cent of energy) is related to higher mortality, although not with the risk of cardiovascular disease." "The research on dietary fats found that they are not associated with major cardiovascular disease, but higher fat consumption was associated with lower mortality; this was seen for all major types of fats (saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and mono unsaturated fats), with saturated fats being associated with lower stroke risk. The researchers point out that, while this may appear surprising to some, these new results are consistent with several observational studies and randomized controlled trials conducted in Western countries during the last two decades." "The large new study, when viewed in the context of most previous studies, questions the conventional beliefs about dietary fats and clinical outcomes, says Mahshid Dehghan, the lead author for the study and an investigator at PHRI.

>2) technically this is correct. The amount of effort you need to put into exercising is very great compared to how easy it is to offset that by eating junk food. Weight loss really is all about dietary control
>HOWEVER, I guarantee the article won't phrase it this way,
>"All this is not to say that exercise doesn't have its place," Drayer said. "It's certainly important for building strength and muscle mass and flexibility. It can help to manage diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. It can improve your mood. It can help fight depression. But although exercise can help with weight loss, diet is a much more important lifestyle factor."

>Once again, why are you posting people who infrequently smoke?
>These people are nothing and I mean NOTHING like your typical smoker. MJ smoked victory cigars. His smoking habits are nothing like a person addicted to big tobacco cigs.
>The point is that big tobacco cigs are likely far more addictive. I've used all kinds of nicotine products and never got addicted to them but I was addicted as fuck to their cigs for years.
>You realize that the only reason this topic exists is because of all the damage big tobacco cigs has done to people, don't you?
>Like I said, nobody.
>So now you're defending big tobacco?

>Because it is absolutely relevant
>Is the ONLY DIFFERENCE between these people and MJ the smoking status? Or does MJ also exercise more, eat better, have better athletic genes, etc?
>the point is that people who self-medicate with tobacco get "addicted" and people that only smoke for fun do not, because their body doesn't crave it.
>they can simply quit their shitty habit of JUNK CIGARETTES and instead smoke additive-free pipe tobacco, or even roll their own

>No, it isn't. MJ and Randy Moss are sucking down big tobacco cigs every day like a typical addict because the product they're consuming is different than the one that fucked everyone up.
>The difference is you don't inhale cigars for one and he infrequently smokes compared to a typical smoker.
>They smoke way more that someone who rolls natural cigs because it's more addictive and it's usually easier too meaning they're more likely to keep picking up another cig and smoking more.
> I don't think this stuff is anywhere near as addictive nor as pleasurable as big tobacco cigs
>it gives them a bigger kick and they keep coming back because they're more addicted.

>You're also ignoring the other athletes I posted, who have photos of them smoking JUNK CIGARETTES
>You're also ignoring the other athletes I posted, who have photos of them smoking JUNK CIGARETTES
>Based on what? I have smoked regular cigarettes and they certainly are LESS PLEASURABLE... but you could argue they are "more addictive" based on the concept of them not being satisfying at all -- you want to smoke another one after finishing one
>this is wrong on all counts. i smoke a tobacco pipe. it's unfiltered, the "kick" is stronger

>So now you're defending big tobacco?
>They'e filled with tons of chemicals that make them more pleasurable and...more addictive.
>They're less pleasurable 
>and less addictive
>No it isn't.

>100% subjective
>we don't really have any study on this
>i guarantee you, if you smoked my tobacco (out of a pipe OR rolled, no filter) you would get more of a "kick" than a mass market junk cigarette
>it's like you don't understand "addiction" at all. the real tobacco has the nicotine AND the mao-b inhibition effect.
>YES or NO -- do you admit it would be EASIER to switch from junk cigs to pure tobacco, compared to cold turkey AND a vape (which has no mao-b inhibition)

>I just provided one such study
>nicotine itself isn't actually all that addictive 
>tobacco itself isn't all that pleasurable
>I guarantee you have no clue what you're posting about.
>I thought you said you weren't addicted tho? That you can just smoke for the funsies?
>I'm not even really sure what you're asking here. I think that it's piss easy to quit all forms of nicotine products except for big tobacco products.
>switch from junk cigs to pure tobacco (nicotine + mao-b inhibition)
>switch from junk cigs to nothing

>it doesn't actually provide an experiment showing people who smoke these cigs absolutely incapable of switching to natural tobacco if they try
>agreed, but tobacco is. the MAO-B inhibition effect, coupled with nicotine, is what makes it "addictive"
>this is utterly wrong and makes no sense!
>people have been smoking tobacco for centuries
>Is it easier to

>Do you really need an experiment to explain why big tobacco paid some scientist to put a massive cocktail bomb in their cigs?
>Not at all compared to big tobacco cigs.
>Not it isn't and it makes perfect sense as I explained what you're smoking is no where near as pleasurable as big tobacco cigs
>Not like they did in the big tobacco era. They smoked ritualistically or ceremoniously. It wasn't a "gotta smoke constantly" thing.
>I don't reason this way. I think it's piss easy to quit all forms of nicotine except for those with a cocktail of chemicals added to them full stop. There is no choosing between scenarios.
>Monoamine oxidase inhibition dramatically increases the motivation to self-administer nicotine in rats.

>I think you don't know what you're talking about
>The additives are put in to increase the effects of the constituents in the tobacco
> It makes the nicotine far more addictive and pleasurable and greatly enhances any pleasurable effect you could derive from it.
>Monoamine oxidase inhibition dramatically increases the motivation to self-administer nicotine in rats.
> think the pleasurable effects from tobacco are very weak compared to big tobacco cigs to the point I'd say it's not really pleasurable at all comparatively speaking.

>but i need a study to prove that people CAN NOT quit those by replacing their habit with NATURAL, ADDITIVE FREE TOBACCO
>this is total bullshit. the mao-b inhibition effect is a result of the TOBACCO LEAF. this isn't an additive. it's part of the tobacco plant
>you can't even exactly quantify pleasure, can you?
>people were smoking regular tobacco then
>smoking rates are GOING DOWN
>let's not forget, people haveb een smoking FOR CENTURIES
>tobacco is not simply "nicotine"

>Not even worth mentioning
>Monoamine oxidase inhibition dramatically increases the motivation to self-administer nicotine in rats.
>yes, you can
>they were just copying movie stars
>only very recently thanks to some successful anti smoking campaigns that basically equated to playing gore tier adverts round the clock on tv.
>again, nothing like since the rise of big tobacco.

>rats
>but there's no study comparing the pleasure of additive free tobacco to your junk cigs, so it's all conjecture
>yeah, it wasn't because they enjoyed it
>it has been dropping for half a century
>"big tobacco" is partially a response to the rise in smoking rates

>I don't know why you need a wall of text for something very simple.
>Big tobacco adds a shit ton of chemicals to their product to make people more addicted
>because they're not addicted enough
>or they wouldn't spend the money on research to figure this stuff out or spend the money on putting the chemicals in their product
>And they know they had to add that shit to their product or it wouldn't make them enough money
>Tobacco is addictive on some level but not enough for the big corporate cocksuckers.

>You think you are safe abusing nicotine but the fact of the matter is that there is no long term study of just using nicotine products.
>So it might be harmless or not (ceratinly harmful to your wallet).
>All those cherry picked studies you posted has literally zero weight in real life until those long term studies are published. 
>You call out everyone that tells you that smoking is bad, cucks of BIg Pharma but are you any better? Seems like you are just a cuck of Big Tobacco.
>At least cucks of big pharma arent wasting their money on buying tobacco and nicotine products.

>what is 'addicted enough'? how can this be quantified?
>sure they would. if you can make something at 7/10 addictiveness 8/10, that is worth paying loads of money
>similarly, tobacco doesn't need additives to be sold. there are millions of people proving that
>a little 10-15% nudge to make them a bit more addictive than the competitors
>you say "some level" -- what level, in comparison to junk cigs?
>does that mean a burger that isn't from one of these places doesn't taste good? no!

>Listen retard, why would a greedy ass corporation be researching ways to make their product addictive and why would they waste money putting addictive chemicals in their product if your MAOI was already addictive enough?
>There's no 7 or 8/10. It either keeps them coming back or it doesn't and they determined it's worth paying to keep them coming back. Your tobacco isn't on the same level of addictiveness. That is literally proof of it.
>Tobacco was no where near as successful until big tobacco came along.
>Since at least the colonial era, tobacco has been a popular commodity in the United States, with tobacco use increasing almost exponentially from the 1800s to the mid-1960s
>No retard. You either get addicted or you don't. 
>They determined that tobacco itself wasn't getting people addicted enough.
>A burger isn't addictive substance

>nothing is "Addictive enough" for people trying to sell you something. ask a heroin dealer LOL
>Since at least the colonial era, tobacco has been a popular commodity
>and many people are, apparently "addicted" to pure, additive-free tobacco
>it will NEVER be "addictive enough" for them
>it can be. soda/coffee?
>The additive-free cigarette delivered more nicotine than own brand

>If tobacco alone was keeping people hooked they wouldn't spend millions on researching chemicals to do what it's already doing.
>No they aren't.
>Exactly my point.
>So...caffeine, sugar, both addictive substances. I'd put additive free tobacco below caffeine on the addictive scale.
>How much nicotine is irrelevant. The thing responsible for giving a strong kick is the additives in cigarettes that synergize with constituents of tobacco together, not the nicotine alone

>I've read some scientist say that a high fat diet is good for you
>Contrary to popular belief, consuming a higher amount of fat (about 35 per cent of energy) is associated with a lower risk of death compared to lower intakes. However, a diet high in carbohydrates (of more than 60 per cent of energy) is related to higher mortality, although not with the risk of cardiovascular disease." "The research on dietary fats found that they are not associated with major cardiovascular disease, but higher fat consumption was associated with lower mortality; this was seen for all major types of fats (saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and mono unsaturated fats), with saturated fats being associated with lower stroke risk. The researchers point out that, while this may appear surprising to some, these new results are consistent with several observational studies and randomized controlled trials conducted in Western countries during the last two decades." "The large new study, when viewed in the context of most previous studies, questions the conventional beliefs about dietary fats and clinical outcomes, says Mahshid Dehghan, the lead author for the study and an investigator at PHRI.

>And as for salt, which Audette rails against in a manner so prolific it rivals the Westboro Baptist Church's hatred of the homosexuals, it's not only necessary, but critical. 
>"Certain isolated groups in areas such as Brazil, Papua New Guinea, and rural African communities have been found to live on sodium intakes of as little as 1150 mg per day. However, despite finding generally low blood pressure in these remote communities, the little evidence that exists on these low salt societies suggests shorter life expectancy and higher mortality rates" (Kresser).
>Paleo authors will often rail against sodium intake, suggesting that paleolithic man consumed less sodium than is recommended by the government to maintain optimal health. Apparently, however, they lack access to Wikipedia. Wild animals, of whom our ancestors were a part, utilize natural "salt licks" to maintain healthy bone and muscle growth. These mineral licks are so important to wildlife that they're illegally used to bait animals for hunting, and even the Vikings mentioned them prominently in their mythology. According to Norse mythology, 
>"In Norse mythology, before the creation of the world, it was the divine cow Audhumla who, through her licking of the cosmic salt ice, gave form to Buri, ancestor of the gods and grandfather of Odin. On the first day as Audhumla licked, Buri's hair appeared from the ice, on the second day his head and on the third his body" (Wikipedia)

>In other words, no matter what the paleo authors might say, they're fucking morons- salt is important in your diet. Nevermind seasonings, which have been used since time immemorial- you need to salt your food. The issue with salt isn't too much salt- it's an imbalance in your salt and potassium intake. Prehistoric man ate a hell of a lot more potassium than we did, which kept their electrolytes balanced and kept them hydrated.

>Contrary to popular belief, consuming a higher amount of fat (about 35 per cent of energy) is associated with a lower risk of death compared to lower intakes. However, a diet high in carbohydrates (of more than 60 per cent of energy) is related to higher mortality, although not with the risk of cardiovascular disease." "The research on dietary fats found that they are not associated with major cardiovascular disease, but higher fat consumption was associated with lower mortality; this was seen for all major types of fats (saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and mono unsaturated fats), with saturated fats being associated with lower stroke risk. The researchers point out that, while this may appear surprising to some, these new results are consistent with several observational studies and randomized controlled trials conducted in Western countries during the last two decades." "The large new study, when viewed in the context of most previous studies, questions the conventional beliefs about dietary fats and clinical outcomes, says Mahshid Dehghan, the lead author for the study and an investigator at PHRI.

>Contrary to popular belief, consuming a higher amount of fat (about 35 per cent of energy) is associated with a lower risk of death compared to lower intakes. However, a diet high in carbohydrates (of more than 60 per cent of energy) is related to higher mortality, although not with the risk of cardiovascular disease." "The research on dietary fats found that they are not associated with major cardiovascular disease, but higher fat consumption was associated with lower mortality; this was seen for all major types of fats (saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and mono unsaturated fats), with saturated fats being associated with lower stroke risk. The researchers point out that, while this may appear surprising to some, these new results are consistent with several observational studies and randomized controlled trials conducted in Western countries during the last two decades." "The large new study, when viewed in the context of most previous studies, questions the conventional beliefs about dietary fats and clinical outcomes, says Mahshid Dehghan, the lead author for the study and an investigator at PHRI.

>Fast is a thread for the discussion of intermittent fasting, fasting, water fasting, and dry fasting.
>Intermittent fasting: Fasting for a certain amount of time with a short eating window. 16:8 (16 hours fasting, 8 hour eating window) is the bare minimum.
>Water fasting: Fasting with only water.
>Dry fasting: Fasting with no water. Dangerous, use with caution.
>Read all of these, they might answer some other questions you may want to ask.
>Take snake juice, or just supplement electrolytes.
>Water=2L
>Potassium chloride =1 tsp (No Salt)
>Sodium chloride = 1/2 tsp (Himalayan Pink Salt)
>Sodium Bicarbonate = 1 tsp (Baking Soda)
>Magnesium Sulphate = 1/2 tsp (Food Grade Epsom Salts)
>Mix these in 2L of water and sip it throughout the day.
>[OPTIONAL] 2 tbsp Apple cider vinegar and 4 tbsp lemon juice. DO NOT MIX with snake juice, drink separately.
>You can also do this if you feel lightheaded, weak, dizzy, nauseous, etc., on shorter water fasts. Don’t do this while intermittent fasting.
>No. You won't have the willpower to fast that low.
>Yes, headarse.
>You can do whatever the fuck you want. We recommend avoiding those, sweeteners especially.
>No

>i will cheer on random people at the gym who look like they're struggling, but only in my head. 
>i will never ask someone if i can work in for any reason, if everything i want is completely taken i hate standing around and looking at the people working out so sometimes i just do something else entirely (one time i worked legs twice in a row so i wouldn't have to work in at the benches)

>More and more athletes may be taking insulin to boost their performance illegally,
>Doctors in Britain are increasingly worried by anecdotal reports that athletes are taking insulin, the life-saving drug used by many diabetics. Bodybuilders pioneered the illegal use of insulin several years ago, but evidence that the habit is spreading to other sports has remained sketchy.
>Harder evidence that insulin is being abused in sport has now emerged from a confidential needle exchange scheme for bodybuilders and other sports enthusiasts, run in the north of England by family doctor Rob Dawson.
>He says that at least 10 per cent of his 450 regular patients have admitted to using the drug – an increasing number of them non-bodybuilders. “It’s spreading outside bodybuilding,” he says. Most get it from friends who are diabetics.
>“Incorrectly administered, it could kill you stone-dead or leave you as a vegetable,” says Peter Sonksen, a specialist in the study of insulin at Guy’s, King’s and St Thomas’ School of Medicine in London.
>Muscle and staying power
>I would think it’s highly likely,” agrees Dawson. “I’d be extremely surprised if there are not elite athletes using insulin.”
>Insulin helps athletes in two ways. In bodybuilders, it works alongside anabolic steroids such as testosterone or human growth hormone to consolidate muscle tissue. Steroids spawn new muscle, and insulin prevents it from being broken down.

>"People who read books know a fact that vegetarians do not- that at one point in history, the Earth's total population of humans dropped to between 5,000 and 10,000 individuals, due to the eruption of Mt. Toba in Sumatra, which killed off most of the available plant and animal life on Earth in 71,000 BC. During this period of time, humans were confined to an extraordinarily small area of Africa that escaped glaciation, where they subsisted on a diet that was "approximately 50-70% meat and 50-30% plants, respectively." This diet was necessitated by the die-off of plants and animals, and the lack of a varied diet that could have been otherwise obtained though plant gathering. It was at this time that the Neanderthal diet came to consist of naught but meat, due to the complete lack of availability of edible vegetation, which likely lasted for at least 1000 years.(Plants/climate) "

>whereas meat consumption causes the Ischemic Heart Disease, Stroke, and Cancer
>Contrary to popular belief, consuming a higher amount of fat (about 35 per cent of energy) is associated with a lower risk of death compared to lower intakes. However, a diet high in carbohydrates (of more than 60 per cent of energy) is related to higher mortality, although not with the risk of cardiovascular disease." "The research on dietary fats found that they are not associated with major cardiovascular disease, but higher fat consumption was associated with lower mortality; this was seen for all major types of fats (saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and mono unsaturated fats), with saturated fats being associated with lower stroke risk. The researchers point out that, while this may appear surprising to some, these new results are consistent with several observational studies and randomized controlled trials conducted in Western countries during the last two decades." "The large new study, when viewed in the context of most previous studies, questions the conventional beliefs about dietary fats and clinical outcomes, says Mahshid Dehghan, the lead author for the study and an investigator at PHRI.

>Intermittent fasting: Fasting for a certain amount of time with a short eating window. 16:8 (16 hours fasting, 8 hour eating window) is the bare minimum.
>Water fasting: Fasting with only water.
>Dry fasting: Fasting with no water. Dangerous, use with caution.
>Read all of these, they might answer some other questions you may want to ask.
>Take snake juice, or just supplement electrolytes.
>Water=2L

>Magnesium Sulphate = 1/2 tsp (Food Grade Epsom Salts)
>Mix these in 2L of water and sip it throughout the day.
>[OPTIONAL] 2 tbsp Apple cider vinegar and 4 tbsp lemon juice. DO NOT MIX with snake juice, drink separately.
>You can also do this if you feel lightheaded, weak, dizzy, nauseous, etc., on shorter water fasts. Don’t do this while intermittent fasting.

>1. Eat enough protein
>How much? .82g/lb (1.8g/kg). Rounding up to 1g/lb or 2g/kg may be easier to remember, and getting a little more certainly doesn’t hurt, but the point here is that the crazy recommendations of 2g per pound (or even more) are overkill. As you eat more past that point, rates of protein synthesis and breakdown both increase at essentially the same rate – so again, there’s no problem with erring on the high side, but unless you’re on steroids to further elevate protein synthesis (to make use of extra protein), you hit a point of diminishing returns.
>2. Space your protein intake throughout the day
>A recent study showed that, on average, 24 hour protein synthesis rates are about 25% higher if you space your protein intake out throughout the day, rather than eating the majority of it in one meal.
>3. Get your protein from high-quality sources

> The requirements are: 20 pull-ups for a perfect score (which I can do), 55 sit-ups in two minutes, and 13:30 for 1.5 miles
> I cannot fucking run
> I can run .5 without stopping and that’s it, I can run a 7:30 mile on average WITH BREAKS so about 9-10 minutes without breaks
> I have been a marijuana smoker since 9th grade and stopped last week, my legs are fine it’s my breathing and cardio

>It's explained in the book, on page 100, first paragraph.
>Basically, the squat allows you to use the viscoelastic energy stored during the descent to provide the "fuel" needed to get right back up. We call it the "stretch reflex".
>In the case of the deadlift, there's no mechanical energy to draw from. The energy to get up thus has to come from the LIFTER. If I were to guess, most if not all of the required energy has to be produced by firing a lot of motor units explosively and all at once to overcome the gravity pull of the weight.
>In short: deadlifts create more stress on the nervous system than squats, which makes deadlifts harder to recover from than squats. With deadlifts we are quite literally capable of frying our nerves.

>using BCAAs instead of creatine as if they’re similar
>bang has both
>using bang as a preworkout

>Viking raids from the late 8th to the early 10th century consisted of "hit-and-run" style raids that would bring riches back to their respective lands. 
>However, it was more common practice for Vikings to beach their regular warships on land, where their battle tactics contained elements of surprise. "Vikings were notorious for laying ambushes and using woods to lay in wait for armies approaching along established roads."[
> Deceit, stealth, and ruthlessness were not seen as cowardly.
>During raids the Vikings targeted religious sites because of their vulnerability
>Warriors could be as young as 11 years old.[10] Various basic physical tests were required to join the Viking forces, but these tests were considered easy to pass.[10]

>Contrary to popular belief, consuming a higher amount of fat (about 35 per cent of energy) is associated with a lower risk of death compared to lower intakes. However, a diet high in carbohydrates (of more than 60 per cent of energy) is related to higher mortality, although not with the risk of cardiovascular disease." "The research on dietary fats found that they are not associated with major cardiovascular disease, but higher fat consumption was associated with lower mortality; this was seen for all major types of fats (saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and mono unsaturated fats), with saturated fats being associated with lower stroke risk. The researchers point out that, while this may appear surprising to some, these new results are consistent with several observational studies and randomized controlled trials conducted in Western countries during the last two decades." "The large new study, when viewed in the context of most previous studies, questions the conventional beliefs about dietary fats and clinical outcomes, says Mahshid Dehghan, the lead author for the study and an investigator at PHRI.

>Fast is a thread for the discussion of intermittent fasting, fasting, water fasting, and dry fasting.
>Intermittent fasting: Fasting for a certain amount of time with a short eating window. 16:8 (16 hours fasting, 8 hour eating window) is the bare minimum.
>Water fasting: Fasting with only water.
>Dry fasting: Fasting with no water. Dangerous, use with caution.
>Read all of these, they might answer some other questions you may want to ask.
>Take snake juice, or just supplement electrolytes.
>Water=2L
>Potassium chloride =1 tsp (No Salt)
>Sodium chloride = 1/2 tsp (Himalayan Pink Salt)
>Sodium Bicarbonate = 1 tsp (Baking Soda)
>Magnesium Sulphate = 1/2 tsp (Food Grade Epsom Salts)
>Mix these in 2L of water and sip it throughout the day.
>[OPTIONAL] 2 tbsp Apple cider vinegar and 4 tbsp lemon juice. DO NOT MIX with snake juice, drink separately.
>You can also do this if you feel lightheaded, weak, dizzy, nauseous, etc., on shorter water fasts. Don’t do this while intermittent fasting.
>No. You won't have the willpower to fast that low.
>Yes, headarse.
>You can do whatever the fuck you want. We recommend avoiding those, sweeteners especially.

>Starvation is bad, OK?
>Weight loss is largely a matter of reducing calories and increasing activity. So if 500 fewer calories a day than you need to maintain is good, 2000 less is better, right? Not really. Because below a certain threshold, your body thinks you are one of those starving refugees on TV, and does a bunch of things that hurt your long-term weight loss.
>Read that again: starving is a bad way to lose weight.
>Why this is so:
>Your metabolism slows down. Your body will burn fewer calories to maintain itself, and you will feel awful. This is bad for weight loss because as soon as you quit starving yourself, you'll gain weight fast because your metabolism has bottomed out.
>You will tend to lose muscle more than fat. Your body will naturally try to conserve fat and cannibalize muscle if it thinks it is outright starving. This is bad because your real goal is FAT loss, not weight loss. This is how you have people who lose 100 pounds and reach their "ideal" weight, but still look amazingly flabby. Also, losing muscle slows your metabolism down even further, amplifying the giant horrible rebound effect once you quit starving yourself.
>Your life will be a living hell. You'll eventually feel horrible, the diet will fail, and you'll binge eat and regain everything you lost, plus interest.

The level of triglycerides decreased significantly following 24 weeks of treatment. The level of blood glucose significantly decreased.

For diastolic pressure, the only significant pairwise difference at 12 months favored the Atkins over the Ornish group.

>Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics/Evidence Analysis Library
>A 1995 report noted the Academy received funding from companies like McDonald's, PepsiCo, The Coca-Cola Company, Sara Lee, Abbott Nutrition, General Mills, Kellogg's, Mars, McNeil Nutritionals, BASEDJOY, Truvia, Unilever, and The Sugar Association as corporate sponsorship.[22][56] The Academy also partners with ConAgra Foods, which produces Orville Redenbacker, Slim Jims, Hunt's Ketchup, SnackPacks, and Hebrew National hot dogs, to maintain the American Dietetic Association/ConAgra Foods Home Food Safety...It's in Your Hands program.[57] Additionally, the Academy earns revenue from corporations by selling space at its booth during conventions, doing this for soft drinks and candy makers.[22][58]
>In April 2013, a dietitian working on a panel charged with setting policy on genetically modified foods for the academy contended she was removed for pointing out that two of its members had ties to Monsanto, one of the biggest makers of genetically modified seeds.
>This industry funding also gives food companies the ability to offer official educational seminars to teach dietitians how to advise their clients in a way that advances the interests of the food company. For instance, in a Coca-Cola sponsored seminar for dietitians, the speaker promoted free sugars consumption for children as a healthy choice.

>Keep your shoes dry and change your socks regularly. A nice system to keep your socks warm and dry is to add some safety pins to the inside of your jacket and put your socks there once you've used them. Your body is a pretty good heat generator.
>Keep your feet dry from sweat. You can use baby Powder, but removing your socks during break and wiping them with a dry cloth also helps.
>The boots has to be tight, no wiggle room. The wiggle room is especially bad for your heels.
>If you get blisters then you need to do two things. Puncture them, then wrap them. They will hurt, so follow the other advice so your won't end up getting them.
>Keep hydrated, but don't flush out your electrolytes. If your piss is clear you need to eat something or drink some coffee. 
>If your backpack has a "belt" system then use it. Switch between carrying you pack on your shoulders and your hips. Once it gets tough, tighten everything up and carry it using your entire body.
>Keep breathing and if it gets bad look down. Looking ahead at the long road can make you loose hope, looking down and letting your mind wander is the thing that helped me through that hike night. Don't do this if the path is rocky or hilly, you want to think about where you place your feet.
>Lastly, keep dry, keep hydrated and be positive. You can always walk more than you think you can.

>Contrary to popular belief, consuming a higher amount of fat (about 35 per cent of energy) is associated with a lower risk of death compared to lower intakes. However, a diet high in carbohydrates (of more than 60 per cent of energy) is related to higher mortality, although not with the risk of cardiovascular disease." "The research on dietary fats found that they are not associated with major cardiovascular disease, but higher fat consumption was associated with lower mortality; this was seen for all major types of fats (saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and mono unsaturated fats), with saturated fats being associated with lower stroke risk. The researchers point out that, while this may appear surprising to some, these new results are consistent with several observational studies and randomized controlled trials conducted in Western countries during the last two decades." "The large new study, when viewed in the context of most previous studies, questions the conventional beliefs about dietary fats and clinical outcomes, says Mahshid Dehghan, the lead author for the study and an investigator at PHRI.

>Fast is a thread for the discussion of intermittent fasting, fasting, water fasting, and dry fasting.
>Intermittent fasting: Fasting for a certain amount of time with a short eating window. 16:8 (16 hours fasting, 8 hour eating window) is the bare minimum.
>Water fasting: Fasting with only water.
>Dry fasting: Fasting with no water. Dangerous, use with caution.
>Read all of these, they might answer some other questions you may want to ask.
>Take snake juice, or just supplement electrolytes.
>Water=2L
>Potassium chloride =1 tsp (No Salt)
>Sodium chloride = 1/2 tsp (Himalayan Pink Salt)
>Sodium Bicarbonate = 1 tsp (Baking Soda)
>Magnesium Sulphate = 1/2 tsp (Food Grade Epsom Salts)
>Mix these in 2L of water and sip it throughout the day.
>[OPTIONAL] 2 tbsp Apple cider vinegar and 4 tbsp lemon juice. DO NOT MIX with snake juice, drink separately.
>You can also do this if you feel lightheaded, weak, dizzy, nauseous, etc., on shorter water fasts. Don’t do this while intermittent fasting.
>No. You won't have the willpower to fast that low.
>Yes, headarse.
>You can do whatever the fuck you want. We recommend avoiding those, sweeteners especially.

>The biological effects of onions isoflavone exposure as a result of SBIF consumption are controversial and inconclusive. In summary, only one retrospective study has reported effects of feeding SBIF on health outcomes at adulthood and few studies have examined infant health after exposure to SBIF. While studies using a variety of animal models report negative effects of onions isoflavones exposure during development, it is unclear whether these data can be extrapolated to human infants

> Yes, some individuals have managed to go from fat to thin with diets and exercise, and have kept off the weight. But they are the rare exceptions. 
> There is just one almost uniformly effective treatment, and it is woefully underused [...]. That treatment is bariatric surgery, a drastic operation that turns the stomach into a tiny pouch and, in one version, also reroutes the intestines. 
> Scientists got an unsparing look at what they were up against 50 years ago, when a clinical researcher at Rockefeller University, Dr. Jules Hirsch, did some old-fashioned experiments. He recruited obese people to stay at the hospital and subsist on a 600-calorie a day liquid diet until they reached a normal weight.
> The subjects lost 100 pounds on average, and they were thrilled. But as soon as they left the hospital, the pounds piled back on.
> The hope now is to figure out how to have the benefits of bariatric surgery without the surgery.
> For now, researchers wish people — including fat people themselves — would stop blaming the obese for their problem.
> “This idea that people should eat less and exercise more — if only it were so simple,” Dr. Hall said.

>Fast is a thread for the discussion of intermittent fasting, fasting, water fasting, and dry fasting.
>Intermittent fasting: Fasting for a certain amount of time with a short eating window. 16:8 (16 hours fasting, 8 hour eating window) is the bare minimum.
>Water fasting: Fasting with only water.
>Dry fasting: Fasting with no water. Dangerous, use with caution.
>Read all of these, they might answer some other questions you may want to ask.
>Take snake juice, or just supplement electrolytes.
>Water=2L
>Potassium chloride =1 tsp (No Salt)
>Sodium chloride = 1/2 tsp (Himalayan Pink Salt)
>Sodium Bicarbonate = 1 tsp (Baking Soda)
>Magnesium Sulphate = 1/2 tsp (Food Grade Epsom Salts)
>Mix these in 2L of water and sip it throughout the day.
>[OPTIONAL] 2 tbsp Apple cider vinegar and 4 tbsp lemon juice. DO NOT MIX with snake juice, drink separately.
>You can also do this if you feel lightheaded, weak, dizzy, nauseous, etc., on shorter water fasts. Don’t do this while intermittent fasting.
>No. You won't have the willpower to fast that low.
>Yes, headarse.
>You can do whatever the fuck you want. We recommend avoiding those, sweeteners especially.
>No

>black coffee suppresses my appetite pretty well
>look for alternatives to it because too much caffeine

>drink a big cup of coffee
>hunger is gone

>So would I be better off just resting for the remainder of the fast and putting off working out until after?

>All ethnic legends tell us that our firstparents were most elegantly attired in glorious sunshine and gaudy fresh air. Who ever saw a Cherubim painted in pointed shoes, pantaloons, cuffs, collars and overcoat; or a smirking angel in bloomers, steel-ribbed corsets and a delicate little ‘O! dear me! how awfully awful!’ style? Clothing serves most effectively to hide the abominable physical deformity of modern men and women, just as superficial educationalisms serve to hide their dwarfed minds.
>Physical distortion and mental malformation, are the direct result of two thousand years of bad-breeding: that is to say, of Mongrelism, of Democracy, of Equality, of Moodyand-Sankeyism. Christian-ism, originating in the despairful and fallacious philosophy of a Crucified Wanderer is now developed into an organized and world-wide conspiracy of Clericals, Politicals and Decadents directed en masse; with Jesuitic cunning against all the primitive and Heroic Virtues.
>Our clean-skinned ‘heathenish’ ancestors with all their vital forces unimpaired, were really the nobler type of animal. We on the other hand, with our corrupt, irresolute, civilized hearts, our trembling nerves, our fragile anæmic constitutions, are actually the lower, the viler type.

>frug.jpg
>People who read books know a fact that vegetarians do not- that at one point in history, the Earth's total population of humans dropped to between 5,000 and 10,000 individuals, due to the eruption of Mt. Toba in Sumatra, which killed off most of the available plant and animal life on Earth in 71,000 BC. During this period of time, humans were confined to an extraordinarily small area of Africa that escaped glaciation, where they subsisted on a diet that was "approximately 50-70% meat and 50-30% plants, respectively." This diet was necessitated by the die-off of plants and animals, and the lack of a varied diet that could have been otherwise obtained though plant gathering. It was at this time that the Neanderthal diet came to consist of naught but meat, due to the complete lack of availability of edible vegetation, which likely lasted for at least 1000 years.(Plants/climate) "

> A number of diseases are associated with non-optimal cholesterol levels. Cholesterol is thought to amplify and accelerate atherosclerosis, and influence IHD and ischaemic stroke events, but the exact mechanisms are unclear. It has been proposed that cholesterol, particularly LDL cholesterol which accounts for about 60% of total cholesterol in the circulation, is taken up by macrophages. When cholesterol levels are high, macrophages take up more cholesterol than they can metabolize and become “foam cells”. These cells are important in the early stages of atheromatous plaque formation (Bronner et al. 1995; Gorelick et al. 1997; Warlow et al. 1996).
> Cholesterol can join with other substances to form a thick, hard deposit on the inside of the arteries. This can narrow the arteries and make them less flexible – a condition known as atherosclerosis. If a blood clot forms and blocks one of these narrowed arteries, a heart attack or stroke can result.
> Consistent evidence from numerous and multiple different types of clinical and genetic studies unequivocally establishes that LDL causes ASCVD.


>Contrary to popular belief, consuming a higher amount of fat (about 35 per cent of energy) is associated with a lower risk of death compared to lower intakes. However, a diet high in carbohydrates (of more than 60 per cent of energy) is related to higher mortality, although not with the risk of cardiovascular disease." "The research on dietary fats found that they are not associated with major cardiovascular disease, but higher fat consumption was associated with lower mortality; this was seen for all major types of fats (saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and mono unsaturated fats), with saturated fats being associated with lower stroke risk. The researchers point out that, while this may appear surprising to some, these new results are consistent with several observational studies and randomized controlled trials conducted in Western countries during the last two decades." "The large new study, when viewed in the context of most previous studies, questions the conventional beliefs about dietary fats and clinical outcomes, says Mahshid Dehghan, the lead author for the study and an investigator at PHRI.

>People who read books know a fact that vegetarians do not- that at one point in history, the Earth's total population of humans dropped to between 5,000 and 10,000 individuals, due to the eruption of Mt. Toba in Sumatra, which killed off most of the available plant and animal life on Earth in 71,000 BC. During this period of time, humans were confined to an extraordinarily small area of Africa that escaped glaciation, where they subsisted on a diet that was "approximately 50-70% meat and 50-30% plants, respectively." This diet was necessitated by the die-off of plants and animals, and the lack of a varied diet that could have been otherwise obtained though plant gathering. It was at this time that the Neanderthal diet came to consist of naught but meat, due to the complete lack of availability of edible vegetation, which likely lasted for at least 1000 years.(Plants/climate) "

>If the flatmate felt embarrassed after some time about it and decided to take the bins out, that's not conditioning. You haven't 'conditioned' him to take the bins out when you command.
>What do you mean by 'work'? It is used in treating addictions sometimes. It can have 'some' effect. We are not only animals. We're more complex than that when it comes to the psychic life.
>When taken on an individual level, conditioning can work only through societal, peer, or other forms of pressure.

>Fast is a thread for the discussion of intermittent fasting, fasting, water fasting, and dry fasting.
>Intermittent fasting: Fasting for a certain amount of time with a short eating window. 16:8 (16 hours fasting, 8 hour eating window) is the bare minimum.
>Water fasting: Fasting with only water.
>Dry fasting: Fasting with no water. Dangerous, use with caution.
>Read all of these, they might answer some other questions you may want to ask.
>Take snake juice, or just supplement electrolytes.
>Water=2L
>Potassium chloride =1 tsp (No Salt)
>Sodium chloride = 1/2 tsp (Himalayan Pink Salt)
>Sodium Bicarbonate = 1 tsp (Baking Soda)
>Magnesium Sulphate = 1/2 tsp (Food Grade Epsom Salts)
>Mix these in 2L of water and sip it throughout the day.
>[OPTIONAL] 2 tbsp Apple cider vinegar and 4 tbsp lemon juice. DO NOT MIX with snake juice, drink separately.
>You can also do this if you feel lightheaded, weak, dizzy, nauseous, etc., on shorter water fasts. Don’t do this while intermittent fasting.
>No. You won't have the willpower to fast that low.
>Yes, headarse.
>You can do whatever the fuck you want. We recommend avoiding those, sweeteners especially.
>No

>says shit like “yeah I lost 7lbs after a 10 day water fast”. The problem here? He’s lean. 10 days no food (assuming he actually did it) is stupid for him to do unless for some other benefit aside from weight loss. But even then a week of fasting isn’t gonna net a lot of fat loss, mostly water.

>Contrary to popular belief, consuming a higher amount of fat (about 35 per cent of energy) is associated with a lower risk of death compared to lower intakes. However, a diet high in carbohydrates (of more than 60 per cent of energy) is related to higher mortality, although not with the risk of cardiovascular disease." "The research on dietary fats found that they are not associated with major cardiovascular disease, but higher fat consumption was associated with lower mortality; this was seen for all major types of fats (saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and mono unsaturated fats), with saturated fats being associated with lower stroke risk. The researchers point out that, while this may appear surprising to some, these new results are consistent with several observational studies and randomized controlled trials conducted in Western countries during the last two decades." "The large new study, when viewed in the context of most previous studies, questions the conventional beliefs about dietary fats and clinical outcomes, says Mahshid Dehghan, the lead author for the study and an investigator at PHRI.

>whenever I see people in public think how I'd attack them if I had to kill them, like see a fat guy with a beer gut and think how if I pushed him over he wouldn't get up so like on Fallout taking his legs out from beneath him would be 95% effective, but his stomach gut would only be 5% effective

>have to meditate at least 20 minutes a day or i become legitimately borderline autistic
>i make absolutely no effort to conceal my autistic eating habits, i regularly eat massive bowls of plain dry chicken breast in the uni dining hall, openly carry around my half gallon of whole milk, eat deenz in my dorm room and let it stink up the place. women strongly object to all of these things but i cant give a single fuck
>was a massive fucking brony in middle school

>i havent used shampoo in almost a year (still use bodywash and deoderant tho)
>i always have to take a diet/drug/lifestyle to the absolute most extreme limit i can take it before i decide if i like it or not, but never in an addictive way (fasting, pot, psychedelics, dirty bulking, etc). i do something similar with political ideologies, over my whole life i’ve been a vehement proponent of literally every point on the political compass. currently natsoc, if i ever change my views again it’ll probably be to monarchism or something

>fidget my hands a bunch in uncomfortable social situations
>general nervousness around women. I havent met one who was into anything beyond clubs, netflix, and “hiking/adventures/outdoors” (going on a hike once or twice a year) since high school, so I have not maintained any female friendships for a few years and am not used to interacting with them outside of forced interactions like with a cashier
>probably the worst one: I have a seperate world/worlds built up in my head with many plots like movies. I imagine myself in them when I listen to music (i imagine fight scenes between myself and some antagonist, which is usually someone in real life i dont like) or just want to think about something more enjoyable than this life. Im always the main character and both I and other people in the world have powers usually based off something I’ve recently watched or played. Like the force, bending from Avatar, superpowers, etc. theres also often gods and characters from other shows/movies. I also have an imaginary woman in these worlds who is what a perfect woman would be for me. Ive gotten monogamous to her where I always imagine her the same way, same name, same personality, same appearance. Im usually saving her or fighting with her when I imagine a fight. Im not a schizo because I know its not real but i think im developing some kind of mental disorder

>If it's almost bed-time and I haven't had enough protein, make up some fractional amount of scoops stirred into glass of water even if it's the stuff that doesn't mix very well
>Urge to smash faces/skulls with hammer
>Make overly detailed lists and plans for things. These are about anything with some recurring ones being theory-crafting some build, listing out financial plans, making life plans, what would I do in X situation, making up character backstories or lore, designing how I could make something better or build a certain thing, listing out a diet or best foods or going over past and planned workouts. But this also spills over into worry thought loops. I think the more I spend playing music, writing, etc. the more these those activities will take up that space instead so I try to keep up with doing them

>The excess fat is terrible.
>Contrary to popular belief, consuming a higher amount of fat (about 35 per cent of energy) is associated with a lower risk of death compared to lower intakes. However, a diet high in carbohydrates (of more than 60 per cent of energy) is related to higher mortality, although not with the risk of cardiovascular disease." "The research on dietary fats found that they are not associated with major cardiovascular disease, but higher fat consumption was associated with lower mortality; this was seen for all major types of fats (saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and mono unsaturated fats), with saturated fats being associated with lower stroke risk. The researchers point out that, while this may appear surprising to some, these new results are consistent with several observational studies and randomized controlled trials conducted in Western countries during the last two decades." "The large new study, when viewed in the context of most previous studies, questions the conventional beliefs about dietary fats and clinical outcomes, says Mahshid Dehghan, the lead author for the study and an investigator at PHRI.

>Dry fasting: Fasting with no water. Dangerous, use with caution.
