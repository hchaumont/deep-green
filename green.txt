>You fully intend on killing the person you thought was the antichrist earlier
>You feel like you've been poisoned, have something in your blood such as Satan himself or aids, and you cut yourself to try to get it out
>You ave to follow specific orders or else you will die, for me it was I had to have a plan for the future, at first it was only ling term plans (lol I'm going to ve an artist/musician/scientist/invent a time machine to stop the bad event) which turned into having to plan for the next day (I'm not goibg to die you stupid fucking demon god Satan ciollective unconscious bullshit, I have to pay the guitar tomorrow, I have to hang out with my brother tomorrow, you fucking cunt bitch ass Satan God leave me the fuck alone an let me sleep without fear of death it's 5 in the morning i have to wake up at 7 fuck off cunt) if that seems too non suicidal for you, come up with something else like the voice is making you lock doors an unlock them 50 times or you'll be forced to take a diahrrea shit in the middle of the highest end restraunt you know

>Oxygen radicals can attack many cellular molecules. In addition to protein and DNA modification (reviewed in Ref. 312), damage to membrane lipids is also very relevant for life span determination. The susceptibility of membrane lipids to oxidative damage is related to two traits. The first is that oxygen and many radical species are several times more soluble in lipid membrane bilayers than in the aqueous solution (246). The second property is related to the fact that not all fatty acid chains are equally susceptible to damage. It is this second property that is the key to the link between membrane composition and oxidative damage to membranes. The carbon atoms that are most susceptible to radical attack are the single-bonded carbons between the double-bonded carbons of the acyl chains (124). The hydrogen atoms attached to these carbons are called bis-allylic hydrogens. This means that saturated and monounsaturated fatty acyl chains (SFA and MUFA, respectively) are essentially resistant to peroxidation while PUFA are damaged. Furthermore, the greater the degree of polyunsaturation of PUFA, the more prone it is to peroxidative damage. 
 
>Holman (148) empirically determined (by measurement of oxygen consumption) the relative susceptibilities of the different acyl chains (see Fig. 1). Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the highly polyunsaturated omega-3 PUFA with six double bonds, is extremely susceptible to peroxidative attack and is eight times more prone to peroxidation than linoleic acid (LA), which has only two double bonds. DHA is 320 times more susceptible to peroxidation than the monounsaturated oleic acid (OA) (148). With the combination of the relative susceptibilities of different fatty acids with the fatty acid composition of membrane lipids, it is possible to calculate a peroxidation index (a measure of the susceptibility to peroxidation) for any particular membrane.1
> I started taking fish oil and noticed an immediate difference. 
>All of my mental problems cleared up within a matter of months.
>"...When the corn-oil diet was supplemented with 14.5% cod liver oil or 12.5% salmon oil, the fatty acid composition of brain PUFA was significantly altered, even if alpha-tocopherol was added to the salmon-oil diet. Comparing salmon-oil- and cod-liver-oil-fed animals with corn-oil-fed animals, arachidonic acid 22:4(n-6) and 22:5(n-6) were reduced, and 20:5(n-3), 22:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3) were increased. Liver fatty acids were also significantly altered. Thus, THE BRAIN IS NOT PROTECTED AGAINST A LARGE EXCESS OF VERY-LONG-CHAIN N-3 PUFA, WHICH INCREASE N-3/N-6 RATIO AND COULD LEAD TO ABNORMAL FUNCTION, AND WHICH MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO REVERSE."

> Adults with C-PTSD have sometimes experienced prolonged interpersonal traumatization beginning in childhood, rather than, or as well as, in adulthood. These early injuries interrupt the development of a robust sense of self and of others.
> Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD; also known as complex trauma disorder)[1] is a psychological disorder that can develop in response to prolonged, repeated experience of interpersonal trauma in a context in which the individual has little or no chance of escape.
> Because physical and emotional pain or neglect was often inflicted by attachment figures such as caregivers or older siblings, these individuals may develop a sense that they are fundamentally flawed and that others cannot be relied upon.
> Changes in self-perception, such as a sense of helplessness or paralysis of initiative, shame, guilt and self-blame, a sense of defilement or stigma, and a sense of being completely different from other human beings (may include a sense of specialness, utter aloneness, a belief that no other person can understand, or a feeling of nonhuman identity).
> persistent dysphoria, chronic suicidal preoccupation, self injury, explosive or extremely inhibited anger (may alternate), and compulsive or extremely inhibited sexuality (may alternate).
> Alterations in relations with others, such as isolation and withdrawal, disruption in intimate relationships, a repeated search for a rescuer (may alternate with isolation and withdrawal), persistent distrust, and repeated failures of self-protection.

>The first is more beautiful than any other. Her capacity for lovemaking is unequal, and she is of high status and has blood ties to noble families. Takng her would definitely prove invaluable to any mercantile ventures you might pursue. Her upbringing took place here in the palace, and she was trained to have proper ettiquette in all arenas. However, she has a promiscuous side to her. A tight leash is advised to keep her from straying.
>The second is rather plain to look at, but she has a loving personality about her. She will dote on you, cook for you, and cling to your arm, but she is rather boring and tends to lounge most days. She has been bedded a fair number of times. Her upbringing involved a degree of work and struggle as an innkeeper. She should stay by your side for as long as you treat her well.
>The third is well...her face might look better after tenderizing it with a mallet, but if appearance isn't a crucial matter, you may just be smitten by her. She will do anything you ask. She will follow you to the ends of the earth. She has been touched by no man, but she remains in my palace simply because she's the most pleasant of all my women to live with. Her intellect is boundless as she reads often, but she is not boastful in the slightest. She hails from a peasant family, and knows the meaning of hard work and dedication. If you seek a lifelong mate, she's the one.
>Finally, the last is a set of twins. Both are of moderate beauty, but their demeanors are starkly different. One is subtle and submissive, while the other is fiery and commanding. They have satisfied me a fair number of times. They were separated at birth and raised by both poor and rich families. Each will remain at your side so long as their twin does as well.

>Except the founding fathers wanted to abolish slavery, but felt like it was best for a later date.
>The original United States Naturalization Law of March 26, 1790 (1 Stat. 103) provided the first rules to be followed by the United States in the granting of national citizenship. This law limited naturalization to immigrants who were free White persons of good character. It thus excluded Native Americans, indentured servants, slaves, free blacks and later Asians, although free blacks were allowed citizenship at the state level in certain states.
>Nevertheless, as it was passed by the same Congress who enacted the Bill of Rights, including members who had participated in the Constitutional Convention, The Act of 1790 is thought to be an indicator of what the nation's Founders thought about the powers of the U.S. Government over immigration.
>They also recognized the Native Americans were inhabiting areas near the whites and Andrew Jackson was the one to really push them out. 
>You can fix the immigration problem by simply telling your fellow whites to quit invading countries.
>Every immigrant is immigrating because a white person decided to cause a war,

>/pol/tards blab about it being some Jewish conspiracy

>(c) Under your supervision, consent and orders, the governments of our countries which act as your agents, attack us on a daily basis;
>(i) These governments prevent our people from establishing the Islamic Shariah, using violence and lies to do so.
>(ii) These governments give us a taste of humiliation, and places us in a large prison of fear and subdual.
>(iii) These governments steal our Ummah's wealth and sell them to you at a paltry price.
>(iv) These governments have surrendered to the Jews, and handed them most of Palestine, acknowledging the existence of their state over the dismembered limbs of their own people.
>(v) The removal of these governments is an obligation upon us, and a necessary step to free the Ummah, to make the Shariah the supreme law and to regain Palestine. And our fight against these governments is not separate from out fight against you.

>thinking the proverb was referencing a literal fire
>the village= family, community, maybe an actual village
>burn it down= become self destructive or lash out towards others in the community
>feel its warmth= be acknowledged by the community

>I'm just going to go along with it and assume you live in some huge city like NYC or some shitty suburb where no one interacts with each other and you genuinely have no idea what a community is.
>The community is made up of the people who live around you, whether they be family members, peer groups or neighbors
>In rural/ancient Africa, people would live in the same general area witht the same families for neighbors for centuries

>Yes it is true. If you go to any small rural town, you'll see it's true.
>What the fuck are you talking about?
>Your community can be some shitty Internet forum if you want it to be. Humans created communities, it's literally our nature.

>Are you implying that communities only exist within families?
>So you don't understand what a communit is.
>Stop trying to act like an expert.
>When I'd go to my grandmother's house, I'd play with the kids next door to her. I knew the old man across the street. There was the lady on the corner who would come over sometimes and keep my grandma company when she was alone. One of my mom's old high school teachers lived on the street. On the 4th of July, my grandma would invite the whole block over to her house for a cookout. This is a community.
>A community is made up of the people who live in a small area.

>so a "village" is defined now as feelings?
>from what i understand about a "village" it is defined as a self-contained political district. it's not a "political thing" it's just for census, post, etc. 
>however, it also has a lot of blacks. and recently has been flooded with puerto rican mestizos. therefore, it is absolutely in no way a 'tribe' it is the furthest thing from that. it has multiple races separated by 10s to 100s of thousands of years of evolution.

>I'm technically not a virgin. I had vaginal intercourse for about 5 minutes with my previous girlfriend in my first year of university. It was the first time for both of us and it was horrible. No nut. She also sucked my dick a few times but it too was horrible. No nut. Broke up with her a few weeks after because she was insane and I thought it was safer for my own mental health to not be with her anymore. I haven't tried to date or hookup since, she moved on after messaging me for weeks and now has a new bf. I know I'm technically not a virgin but it sure fucking feels like it. There was only a minor sense of achievement and confidence that came from technically losing my virginity. I am introverted to a fault and go out of my way to avoid any sort of social interaction. I get invited to do stuff because I put on a good facade of normality and i'm not physically grotesque (maybe a 7 or 7.5 on a good day) and people seem to think I'm funny. I get invited to do social things semi-often but try my best to weasel out. I'm also bad at picking up on social queues from women so that only adds to the problem. All I want out of life is relative financial stability and a qt to have a family with and love me. My self-destructive tendencies actively prevent this which causes me to feel tremendous self-doubt and anxiety. I'm young so there's still time for me and some of you guys too. Some of you are fucked and you have my condolences.

>open message
>she said "threesome tonight. You down?"
>maybe there is a god
>maybe I can finally lose my virginity
>(insert critical thinking gif)
>but what if it's a devils threesome?(me+her+another dude)
>suspicion.exe activates. I ask her "with who" because it'd be pretty gay to be in a devil's threesome. But it'd also be pretty gay to remain a 20 year old virgin.
>I guess Id probably do it if we didn't have to make eye contact
>she responds it would be with her friend Maddie
>faith in God restored. It's just a regular threesome!
>message her a little more about when and where to meet. Can't wait to finally have sex
>unexpected event occurs...she says actually her friend Maddie wants to do some other guy named Marcus instead.
>so were going to all meet up but i'll only bang Jori and Marcus will only bang Maddie.
>well that's not as cool but of course i'm not gonna say no to that. 
>decrease from God tier level night to Jesus tier level night
>message her a little more to finalize details
>she messages me "actually anon, i'm not sure if you wanna do what me and Maddie want to do

>I tell her im really looking forward to seeing her. What does she wanna do anyways
>turns out she wants me and Marcus to jack off in a room together and then when were both rock hard they can come in and catch us and give us bjs then go outside in their backyard and fuck us
>well, the first part sounds kind of gay to me but i love the rest of the plan
>I guess it won't be gay if me and Marcus don't make eye contact
>Decide to go along with it. Text her "im in"
>she also wants me not to wear underwear there
>were going to all meet at Marcus's house. Its 40 miles away so it takes me a while to get there. 
>were all meeting after midnight. I drive there and it starts seeming kind of sketchy
>I get to marcus's house and wait outside in the driveway in my car alone in the middle of the night in this sketchy ass neighborhood
> wonder if this is all a ploy to rob me or murder me or steal my car
>marcus texts me and says he doesn't see me. I must be at the wrong house.
>text Jori a little more. We exchange some naughty pictures. I send her 2 dick pics.
>i've actually never sent a woman a dick pic before but she said she wanted one.
>drive around a little more and look for marcus's house. Apparently I went to the wrong house and sat in their driveway and sexted jori for 30 minutes.
>whoopsie daisy
>eventually i find where Marcus's house really is
>Now I have to really take a piss so I just take a leak in the side of the road like some kind of dirty indian
>after that Marcus comes out to greet me. He's black
>I thought Marcus and Jori and Maddie would all be here but apparently maddie and Jori are still on their way
>suspicion.exe reactivated
>whys it take them so long to get here if my house is over 40 miles away and i accidentally went to the wrong house for 30 minutes and they said they were closer than me?
>whys her tinder say she is 1 mile away if shes driving here?

>"Idk man they wanted us to both be rock hard before they came. Idk man. you know how tinder is glitchy"
>This seems a little suspicious and a little gay to me but I really wanna bang Jori
>please God can I just have sex once before I die?
>feel like leaving but if I get to bang Jori it will be worth it.
>reverse image search some of the pictures Jori sent me and surprisingly don't find anything.
>We go in Marcus's Garage because he still lives with his parents and their asleep. 
>He brings out some lube. I start sexting Jori more and he starts sexting Maddie. 
>I don't really wanna fap in front of him but its Maddies kink and i don't wanna disappoint Maddie because then she and Jori won't come over and bang me and Marcus
>I'm a little suspicious that he's texting me pretending to be a girl named Jori because he's gay but he doesn't look like a faggot to me.
>also he and Jori both texted me from different phone numbers and I doubt he randomly has two phones.
>So I send Jori some more dick pics and she texts me some shit like "it doesn't look like your rock hard yet" and "it doesn't even look like you used lube"
>i never use lube. No lube master race!
>I ask when she's gonna get here. I already drove all the way here from 40 miles away and waited outside the wrong house for 30 minutes and waited for Marcus to let me in for a little and i'm still waiting for her to get here.
>I've already been waiting for her at Marcus's house for 30 minutes or longer and I thought she was gonna be here when I got here. 
>i thought she was gonna have to wait for me since i lived so far away
>reconsider leaving
>still sext with her a little although it's kind of difficult to get an erection now because of all the driving and waiting it's about 4:00 in the morning now and i'm tired as fuck and have a headache from staying up so late waiting to see her and i've been hard for a while now and you can't keep an erection going forever

>now i'm wondering if Jori is even real so when she texts me I ask if she can send me a picture of her with her eyes closed so i can see if she's real.
>she text me some shit like thats not part of the rules and she cant cuz shes driving here.
>Like bitch?! Where the fuck do you live? In another state? You should of gotten here now a long fucking time ago
>you should of been here before i got here
>she says some shit like "don't leave now or you'll ruin the whole thing. Marcus was looking forward to this"
>Marcus was just a few feet away from me fapping to some pictures on his phone, supposedly pictures of Maddie, but I wouldn't know, I didn't see his phone screen.
>They could be pictures of my dick for all i knew.
>He may have made a fake tinder account of someone named Jori and catfished guys off of it because he might secretly be a faggot.
>i've never even seen Jori in real life and she couldn't even send me a picture of her with her eyes closed
>Now I decide i've had about enough of this shit and decide to do the only logical thing there is left to do in this situation.
>I simply get up and walk out the door and drive away without saying anything to Marcus or Jori.

>I was nerdy as fuck, I already taught myself a decent amount of Java programming, although I struggled with math.
>I got bullied for this, I learned really quickly that normies will beat me, demean me, and ostracize me because they envy my intelligence.
>Although I made some friends in kindergarten, and the 1st and 2nd grades, I had literally 0 friends at this time.
>I was effectively an awkward nerdy virgin NEET by the age of 10.
>I discover 4chan, as a typical summerfag, I heard about it through epic memes.

>I was oblivious to the racism, and I posted there to discuss alternative voting systems to prevent gerrymandering, figuring that it was legitimately dedicated to politics.

>It was different, new, exciting, and disturbing
>encountered gore, photographic nudity on /b/
>all of which I had a morbid curiosity about.
>I grew a psychological resistance to the shock-value of the gore from exposing myself to it frequently.
>remember the scruffening, when /mlp/ purged porn from the board. Not sure when this happened, but I think it was 2012.
>This legitimately pissed me off because I was into this porn, literally being a degenerate horsefucker by the age of 11.
>I briefly lurked other chan sites, such as Ponychan, which was created in response to the scruffening.
>There was literal horsefucking beastiality on these sites, and I wasn't fazed because of my resistance to shock value.
>Around this time I started browsing /pol/, using "nigger" a lot.
>Started picking up the edgy humor of 4chan.
>Discovered /r9k/, and I related a lot, because they talked about lonelyness and isolation, which I felt at that time. I had no friends, was awkward, and literally couldn't look a girl in the eye.
>All of this was partially due to the fact that throughout my young childhood years I had been bullied relentlessly. I've been beaten, ostracized, and demeaned for being nerdy and weird.

>I start becoming more of a hardcore brony.
>I should mention, this bullying and shit, combined with a genetic predisposition to mental illness through my mother really have taken a toll on my mental health.

>I own a pet bird and sometimes I've had psychotic episodes staring at it, thinking that it has a camera inside it and that I'm being watched.
>I literally get these thoughts when I'm masturbating that someone is watching me.
>Sometimes think that cars outside are watching me, or that drones are flying by watching me.
>This all culminates when I have a panic episode, thinking that I've ingested "supersaturated salt-water", and think that I'm going to die when it pulls the water out of my body.
>I go to the ER.
>I just drank some water with a little bit of salt dissolved in it, it was all just me freaking out and having a panic attack.
>When I get back, I say to my friends that "my little pony saved me."

>Back in 2012, just after Sandy Hook, I drew a picture of a gun which caught the attention of the school.

>As a consequence of this, I was denied acceptance into the Gifted and Talented middle-school program.
>I become horribly depressed and start doubting my own intelligence.
>My family tries unsuccessfully to fight a lawsuit over the grounds that I was discriminated against for being male.
>In my depression, I confide in /r9k/
>I start to really feel like I am a robot, around 13 years old.
>I find out about NEETs, and I'm enthralled.
>At one point, I legitimately wanted to be one.
>Either way, /r9k/ fueled my hatred for normalfags.
>I actually literally developed an interest in school-shooters and at one point wanted to be one, to get revenge for my bullying and rejection.
>Back in 2nd grade, my first crush was stolen from me.
>Women have treated me like dirt since then.
>I feel like because I'm socially awkward, they treat me as less than human.

>> The Index of Economic Freedom is an annual index and ranking created in 1995 by The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal to measure the degree of economic freedom in the world's nations. The creators of the index took an approach similar to Adam Smith's in The Wealth of Nations, that "basic institutions that protect the liberty of individuals to pursue their own economic interests result in greater prosperity for the larger society
>In this list China ranks in the 110th spot, but Switzerland is ranked in the 4th spot.

>Yeah, this is a common misuse of a technique called establishing make believe goal posts. That index means nothing and if it's the entirety of your measurement system of political discourse, you are just being a little boy claiming that your GI Joe is demonstrably the most kung fu because it said so on a mandarin origami forum.

> For Blue, unstable family relations get resolved, but that means all family members who are in question die, and because of the constant stream of dopamine courses through your body, you don't mourn. 
> Pink, you turn into a grotesque creature that looks like a super mutant to compensate for the new abilities you have. People run in fear, and your only companions are animals. 
> Green, the melodies that run through your mind flood your consciousness and you are driven mad by your need to produce every single one, and it never stops. 
> Orange grants you the knowledge, but no one ever believes you, and you spend the rest of your life trying to convince those around you that what you are saying is true.
> Yellow makes you more beautiful, but because everyone else becomes more beautiful also, it only moves the "standards" so your "10" is still a "6" in others eyes.
> Invisible just depresses you when you accidentally stumble on the date of your death, knowing you can't do anything to change it.
> Black, though raising your IQ, leaves you bombarded with constant questions, even from your closest relatives and friends. You give harsh truths and people don't want to listen, so they leave you.
> White, you have no privacy. You become an object. You never feel like you can have an honest relationship with anyone because you know they are just gawking at your figure. You alienate yourself from everyone with the hopes of finding a place where you can be appreciated for something more than a physical appearance.

>I didn't get her and I didn't want to
>somehow that wasn't the end for us tho I don't know why but she was persistent

>fast forward a couple of weeks I'm in a small friend group w her now somehow
>we would bicker a lot she was really naive at the time and didn't understand why we didn't get along
>she thought I didn't like her which wasn't the case but I was easily set off by her
>probably because she was always so jubilant and I was still a sulky shithead
>When i look back I was such an asshole not only to her but to everyone
>and she was such a sweetheart, for some reason despite the way I was we were still friends by the end of the school year
>fast forward to summer Jess moves close to my house which is pretty far from the school 
>by this point we had both matured quite a bit
>In high school we were both pretty sheltered and we didn't do much but over the course of that year we had matured as much as you can in a year
>both of us lost our virginities(to different ppl obviously) Jess was a lot less naive and I stopped being such a dick after making a couple of close friends
>Jess was now not only more bearable to be around but actually fun to be around and so I was I
>during the summer I started trying to make amends by texting her and we became actual friends
>I started to develop a crush on her at this point
>we both have commitment issues I'm scared of giving my time and efforts to the wrong person and she told me she was the same way which I thought was awesome at first
>I thought I had a chance at getting a girl who I could fuck no strings attached
>we started hanging out one on one a little bit more
>over the course of a couple of months we became real close

>we would watch movies and play video games and board games together 
>she even met some of my family at one point and they loved her
>at this point I like her a lot

>I felt like I could t do anything about it
>I had known that one of my closest friends also had a crush on her so I never really made a move because he had told me way before
>I liked her so much that I couldn't even imagine her liking me back just because I thought so highly of her in my own head
>the closest thing I made to a move was putting my arm around her when we were watching a movie one day
>and so she would come over and we watch movies and cuddle
>everything felt incredibly /comfy/ when she came over
>once my friend realized he didn't really have a chance with her I told him how I felt and I got his blessing
>now I had no excuses to not tell her how I felt
>I knew we weren't gonna see each for a month because we both had trips coming up
>I wanted to tell her how I felt before she left
>three days before we were laying on my bed looking through my phone and her head was on my chest 
>in that moment I wanted to tell her so badly how I felt but I couldn't bring myself to do it
>after she leaves I tell myself there's always tomorrow
>turns out she's busy the last three days before she leaves
>oh
>well you gotta do it now then anon
>and So I Videocall and after a long call when it's getting late and I can't let it fester anymore I tell her

>I'm watching 500 days of summer on the plane right now

>you need to vaccinate close to everyone to achieve herd immunity

>anecdotally
>Given that there is so much resistance to vaccinations in the US, it probably would not be a good idea to force them for the time being because of muh freedumz. We need people to be better educated.

> Study: Whooping cough outbreak linked to vaccinated children
>An investigation by California doctors has revealed that the state's latest outbreak of whooping cough centered around children who had already received the whooping cough vaccine, Reuters reports.
>In 2009, four separate Canadian studies concluded that the seasonal flu shot massively increases the likelihood of contracting the H1N1 flu. According to Science Daily, recipients of the seasonal flu vaccine were up to 250% more likely to be infected by the H1N1 variant than those who did not receive the injection.
> About 50% of infected children less than a year old require hospitalization and nearly 0.5% (1 in 200) die

>>Cannot infect others because they don't have the condition due to others have immunity
>It's a trend that cropped up since 9/11 conspiracy theories died down 
>Could have used the one about the rushed vaccine for Swine Flu leading to some people having narcolepsy but I doubt you've done your homework.
>You have to go back lad

>> Non vaccinated people are more likely to get the virus and inadvertently infect other people
> People who aren't vaccinated are more dangerous to people who are vulnerable. 
>Not even sure what you meant with that last part.
>Can't see how not letting dangerous people near vulnerable people is at all discrimination.

>Well I think mandatory shots for shit like smallpox are a good idea.
>so everyone would get vaccinated!
>I don't trust big pharma, But they're not gonna sell shit that kills their client base.
>The nocebo thing is super fascinating. But counter intuitively, people fear mongering about vaccines will increase that-- there seems to be alot of furor over vaccines.
>I'm still getting my kids vaccinated for certain shit, the government doesn't have to twist my arm for that.
>There was a mention of fines for non-compliance... So it's not exactly treated as a crime, but there is a penalty for it, according to the article.
>as it is un constitutional.

>Fake medical documentation will surge if we make it compulsory 
>Vaccinations are bad because a firm with a monopoly gave me them
>I cannot provide any other evidence that people will want fake documentation other than my own paranoia and personal experience of being rough handled by a nurse
>Cops burst into my house
>Everyone will get fake docs trust me okay I know Vlad from Russia he hack my name onto data base so I avoid vaccines 

>that would create a huge black market for fake vaccine records
>you trust them that every injection they give is magically good? LOL! pathetic
>forcing it will cause the biggest problem. once it's MANDATORY then people will become 100x more skeptical. mostly, people will just get FAKE VACCINE RECORDS and you'll have hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of "vaccinated people" who are actually not vaccinated at all
>but you're OK with having the cops bust in and twist someone else's arm for that? why?
>if the fine is bad enough people will just get fake vaccines. i posted a link showing 30% of ukranians already do this
>thanks for playing =^)

>You're making the assumption that demand will rise since everyone is antivaxxer like yourself
>Go abroad and get them done. You're purposely attacking an enemy you cannot defeat, then providing no reasonable alternative aside from 'just don't get sick trust me I never got sick
>I cannot provide any other evidence that people will want fake documentation other than my own paranoia and personal experience of being rough handled by a nurse
>Non sequitur 
>Everyone will get fake docs

>Why? Because getting small pox or measles suck. And your kids will be in a confined space with other kids during class, and kids are fucking incubators for shit, lol.
>This is weird rationale, you have no basis for this.
>I'm not sure why you're worried about black market faked records. Explain to me what this will do, exactly.
>That's quite a retarded leap in logic for you to make, considering I said I don't necessarily trust them. You obviously have no clue how dangerous some of the stuff we're vaccinated for as kids is. Kids are weak man, a first uncontrolled encounter with some of these diseases will leaving you a grieving parent for the rest of your life.

>Read various books at the same time. When I grab a difficult book or one that makes me sleepy I grab another and switch. This should refresh your head. Keep them thematically different. I read economics and fiction.
>It isn't a race. Reading slowly won't make you sleepy that fast. Try to acknowledge what books are for you to read fast and which aren't.
>Buy the physical copies. When you get the books from your own money you'll feel the need to read them to avoid the feel of wasting your money.
>Start with books highly discussed here so you feel motivated to discuss.

>i felt the same way when i was younger, its really not overstepping, and its super weird to accept in the beginning, but its super normal
>The fact that you realise whether it's socially acceptable or not tells me you're probably not as autistic as you think you are.
>If you think it's too creepy, best to go with your gut. Start by asking her basic shit you think she wants to talk about, like what kind of stuff she's interested in or what she thinks about the new school; just inane garbage to start a conversation.
>Then after you've introduced yourself properly be sure to compliment her when she responds to stuff and tell her you think she's cool, that way she knows you're not just some yappity gossip bitch.
>THEN once you've had at least a conversation or two with her, you can ask what she does on the weekends and if she wants to hang out some time. And if she rejects you, just remember that's okay too, and get on with your life.

>But what if she's not interested? Won't she just be annoyed at this guy forcing her into conversations she's got no desire to be in? I'm really trying to avoid her for outright telling me to piss of
>But do you have any advice on conversation starters that a) don't make it obvious I'm just looking for an excuse to talk to her and b) aren't to personal. Saying things like "you're cool" are not things I'd ever say to her out of the blue in this point in time.

>Carl Jung > Archetypes
>Shadow
>The shadow is simply the black side of someone's personality. And what is black is always known only indirectly through projection. That is, one discovers his black side as something belonging to others: friends, relatives, fictitious characters, etc. This is why the meeting with the personal shadow is considered to be a moral effort. The difficulty of absorbing the shadow is huge if we have to face alone this powerful feature.
>The black side/shadow feature may be also equaled with the Freudian personal unconscious. It comprises everything one repressed because is rejected by his superego. Freud himself linked these repressed contents mainly with the sexual drives. therefore the shadow has almost always a sexual component.
>The shadow is the first to be met when one starts his self analysis. As long as the shadow is not assimilated and controlled by the consciousness it may appear in dreams and fantasies mingled with the anima archetype . Thus one can dream of bad women or witches, of women with personal high power and destructive impulses affecting man's mind and eros. There's also the phallic mother (a female figure endowed with phallic, aggressive powers) - if the dreamer repressed a part of his own aggressiveness.
>The black shadow may appear as an archetype too. The devil's images and features (symbols) are very common to men's dreams. Also the devil-like characters - who compensate the luminous figure of the Saviors - share the shadow realm.

>Type theory conceptualizes personality as a set of cognitive preferences, and people are sorted into different personality categories according to their natural preferences. The categories are not hierarchical (no type is better than the others); they are all considered equal in that each personality type has its own set of strengths and weaknesses and its own unique role to play in the world. In order to understand what type is, the first concept to learn is the difference between cognition and behavior.
>cognition: the perceptual and evaluative mental processes that one uses to make sense of the world and navigate it successfully
>behavior: characteristics, traits, or actions that are often easily observable or measured by others
>A person's type is best identified through cognition as opposed to their manifested behaviors. Too often, people only look at behavior. For example, both ESFPs and ESFJs tend to be open and friendly people. However, the cognitive process that gives rise to the "friendliness" trait and subsequent "friendly" behaviors is different for the two types (Fi versus Fe). Therefore, if you were to try to type someone based only on the observable trait of "friendliness" without knowing why or how that trait arose, it becomes all too easy to mistype or confuse the two types.
>Without cognition, you wouldn't have ideas, thoughts, or feelings, and your behaviors wouldn't have much meaning because you would be ruled only by your autonomous "animal" brain that is geared for physical survival. It is through cognition that we develop a sense of self, make meaning out of life's events, and visualize what is in store for us in the future. This implies that cognitive processes can go awry because some people do not develop a strong sense of self, some people have difficulty finding meaning in life, and some people cannot envision their future self very well.

>You can do whatever you want in the universe and live your life and that's that
>But, if you should happen to, in all possible things you could do in the universe, happen to let a few of those drops of liquid get in one specific place of another human (not even all humans just one certain type, and not even all holes when there are multiple just one specific hole, and not even all the time only during a specific time)
>Then life, a new human, is created

And well pretty much seen him every day as I also played pokemon go on the square regularly.

>Girl #1 is a jealous psychopath. She will kill you if you talk to any girl but her, or if you leave the house for over 8 hours
>Girl #2 is a pyromaniac. She will try to burn your house down once a day. Catching her in the act prompts her to have hot make-up sex with you
>Girl #3 is half-spider. She will roll you into a web cocoon every night & pleasurably suck out large quantities of your blood & cum, but you'll become frail & weak over time
>Girl #4 is a witch. She will regularly turn you into small critters. She is sexually attracted to these critters, & will only have human sex with you after you make her orgasm
>Girl #5 is a slime monster that will devour you on a daily basis. While you can survive this, the risk of suffocation is high. She will begin digesting you if more than 10 minutes is spent inside her
>Girl #6 is an alien. She alters her appearance to look attractive to you, & lets you do what you please with her, but she peforms experiments on you at night that irreversibly mutate your body, but never kill you
>Girl #7 is a blood mage. She will ask you to bring one young woman home every 2 weeks for her to slaughter & bathe in her blood. She will oblige any domestic & sexual favors you desire for doing so. Failing to do so will quickly age her. She can consume all physical evidence of murder, but frequent run-ins with the law is inevitable
>Girl #8 is half-plant. She needs sun, & eats soil & cum to survive, but sex more than once a week will cause her to quickly outgrow your home & escape
>Girl #9 is a mime. She never opens her mouth for anything but food, & turns your home into a more & more complex invisible maze every day. She rewards you with sex for each one you finish

>Girl #2 is a hemophiliac & likes to cut people, drink their blood, & have crazed sex with them afterwards
>Girl #3 is made of slime, & is prone to consuming people whole & suffocating them in her body. She does this because having a human inside her stimulates her greatly
>Girl #4 is a futa with incurable overactive semen producing testes. She orgasms uncontrollably every 20 minutes & shoots thick cum ropes 
>Girl #5 is a thief who steals people's things & destroys them for fun. Being caught red-handed gets her hot
>Girl #6 has giant cow tits that must be milked every hour, or they cause excrutiating pain. Her breasts will explode if ignored for more than 2 hours. Milking makes her very horny
>Girl #7 is a half spider that enwebs humans, wraps them up, & sucks their blood & semen. Her webbing can be wiggled out of, but struggling prompts her to kill her prey
>Girl #8 is totally normal, aside from the fact that she wants to be impregnated constantly & will only have raw vaginal sex. She gives birth to fully developed children in 1 instead of 9 months. The government knows this & will not assist you if you father more than 2.
>Girl #9 is a psycho who will kill you if she sees you speak a word to Any girl besides her. Otherwise she is normal.
>Girl #10 is a beautiful gorgon who petrifies anyone who looks in her eyes (even with glasses). Her hair is made of snakes that bite anyone trying to stroke them. She is otherwise quite lovable.
>Girl #11 is a succubus who hypnotizes people into being sex slaves forever, imprisons them, & drains them of their cum until they die
>Girl #12 lacks the ability to feel anything physically or emotionally & does Anything she is told by anyone

>If only one loves, and they have hundreds of other candidates who love them, then you are just hurting them with your love, since you are comparing yourself with hundreds of others who would be much better for them and thus stealing a slight part away from them. Love is not about hurt. Ergo the best choice is to fight love and eradicate it, snuff it out to prevent hurt.

>girl number two we were juniors in high school. I played bass in a metal band and she was a pudgy gothic girl who liked musicians. Went on one date but was too pussy to make a move. She broke up with me and dated some other guy the next day
>girl three was when were seniors. We were in the most advanced art class (oil painting) together and she was always obsessed with my art. At graduation she was talking with me and Father and later my pops pointed out that she clearly liked me. I never saw her again though
>girl four was the most recent. She started at my work at the beginning of the year and we worked a lot of shifts together (usually just us or one other person). We could spend hours talking and we had similar hobbies. I can still see her smiles when she would see come in to work. She was always full of life and laughter. She eventually lost interest in me and got a boyfriend and we stopped talking. All of coworkers were surprised because they thought we were already a thing but I was too autistic to realize it.

>closed ended so you can nut as hard as you want without making a big mess
>air bubble at the end which serves three purpose: provides an escape for your glans when you're trying to edge and don't want to cum yet, gives space for your glans when you cum so you don't get overstimulated, and provides a reservoir for cum (which there will be a lot of)

>Girl #1 is a jelly. Her body & demeanor are soft & warm. She cannot hold objects heavier than 4 ounces or they'll sink through her. She also cannot wear shoes nor tread on porous or hot surfaces
>Girl #2 is a metamorph. If a creature exists, she can turn into it. No matter her form however, her nature will always be abrasive & domineering
>Girl #3 is a space bandit. She has an impish nature & prefers adventures to domestic life. Taking her out makes her happy & compels her to steal & give you gifts. But you will never be able to settle down as galactic law will pursue her forever
>Girl #4 is an abductor. She loves experimenting on people, then fucking whatever they become. She even gave herself a phallus for fun. Expect to become her subject if you choose her. Tests are never fatal, but effects are permanent
>Girl #5 is an ambassador. She has over 100 tongues in her mouth that she can fully control. She speaks all languages & has a diplomatic nature, but also a high opinion of herself. She likes being pampered
>Girl #6 is an impregnator. She looks normal, but has a long proboscis that retracts into her navel. Any time she has sex, she thrusts it down her mate's throat & spurts 20 ounces of cum that contain thousands of eggs. You will digest these as long as you don't eat for 24 hours, otherwise you will die when they hatch. Your impregnator will love you more than any other girl.
>Girl #7 is a drone. She has been stripped of all emotion, & feels no pleasure or pain. She lives to serve, that is all
>Girl #8 is a mimic. She is kinky, alluring, & always wants sex, but the moment you penetrate her in any way, she warps into a giant maw & devours you. Feeding her a human-sized creature lets you fuck her death-free as much as you want for 2 days
